This changes the wallpaper based on the current time.

# How does this work?

You configure wallpapers for a specific hour. It checks every five seconds if the hour changed and replaces the old wallpaper.

**Limitations**:

You will notice that it changes the wallpaper only for the space you're currently on and first when you switch the space. So far there is 
no API which allows to set a wallpaper for all spaces simultaneously, so I used this workaround.

# Supported

I tested this on Mac OS X 10.10 only so far.
